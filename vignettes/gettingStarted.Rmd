Load `pepr` and read in your project.

```{r}
library('pepr')
p = Project(file = "~/code/microtest/config/microtest_config.yaml")
```

Here's how you can access the metadata:

```{r}
samples(p)
config(p)
```

For now you can also use slots (don't do this, as these may change):

```{r}
p@config
p@samples
```
